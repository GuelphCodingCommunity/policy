# Guelph Coding Community Policy and Procedures

![GCC Logo](img/gcc-logo.png)

The Guelph Coding Community (GCC) is a student organization at the University of Guelph School of Computer Science which is focused on providing students with valuable, hands-on, extracurricular tech skills which cannot normally be acquired through coursework.
Founded in 2013, GCC facilitates student-run workshops, tutorials, demos, and presentations for students of all backgrounds and skill-levels.

GCC workshops are designed by passionate students and guest speakers to teach all manner of new technical skills.
These workshops are targeted at students who share a love of coding, and help to prepare for hackathons and events like the annual [CS Games](https://csgames.org).

Anyone can sign up to run a workshop!
We believe that we learn best from our peers, and want experienced students to help expand the skillsets of Guelph Coders.
