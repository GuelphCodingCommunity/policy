# Meeting Guidelines

1. Meetings must be advertised at least 4 days in advance.
2. The topic of the meeting, and any extra requirements of attendees should be shared beforehand.
3. Meetings must be held in person.
4. Student and/or guest presenters should be contacted prior to the meeting to review materials and ensure that they are appropriate for the audience of students anticapted to attend.
5. A quick ice breaker activity is encouraged before each meeting to get students in a mindset to be relaxed and involved.
6. After the meeting, presentation materials should be kept on file by the GCC Executive, if permitted by the creator of the materials.

# Meeting Format

Meetings will be held in one of two formats.

1. Half an hour to one hour long presentation.

   - Introduce the presenter
   - Set up presenter with A/V equipment
   - Pace the presenter by providing subtle time cues through the
     presentation
   - Allow for optional (but encouraged) question/answer period
   - Thank the presenter --- if they are a guest speaker, present them with a small gift or honourarium

2. One and an half hour to two hour long technical workshop.

   - Introduce the presenter
   - Facilitate set up for workshop participants
   - Check in periodically with presenter to ensure that the workshop is moving at a good pace
   - Thank the presenter --- if they are a guest speaker, present them with a small gift or honourarium

If time remains after a meeting, students should be encouraged to come up and do software demos of personal projects, etc.

# Meeting Attendance

Meeting attendance should only be recorded for the first meeting of each semester.
Following meetings should have a count of attendees recorded for analytical purposes by the Executive, so that advertising and outreach decisions may be better informed.
