The Guelph Coding Community (GCC) is a student organization focused on providing students with valuable, hands-on, technical skills, which are not normally presented in course material.
Founded in 2013, GCC facilitates student-run workshops, tutorials, demos, and presentations for students of all backgrounds and skill-levels.

GCC workshops are designed by passionate students and guest speakers to teach all manner of new skills.
These workshops are targeted at students who share a love of coding and help to prepare for hackathons and events like the annual CS Games.

Anyone can sign up to run a workshop! We believe that we learn best from our peers, and want experienced students to help expand the skillsets of Guelph Coders.
